## List of HTTP status codes

## How to install

Just run

```shell
npm install http-status-codes
```

add the `--save` option to add it to the `dependencies` in your `package.json` as well

## Hot to use

The module will export an object that contains 5 objects that describe
the http status codes where you can find key value pairs of the status codes.

The module was created as simple way of avoiding using `magic numbers`
in the source code to represent the `http statuses` and improve
api readability.

I also hope that it's going to be a good reference for all of us
to go beyond the standard usages of `http status codes` and create
better and more descriptive `API's`.
